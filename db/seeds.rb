# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

		walked = Milestone.new(title:'walked for the first time!')
		walked.save

		talked = Milestone.new(title:'talked for the first time!')
		talked.save

		potty = Milestone.new(title:'used the potty!')
		potty.save
